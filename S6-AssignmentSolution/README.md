MNIST Classification with use of Normalization Layers
-----------------------------------------------------
* In order to classify MNIST digits, 3 Normalization techniques are used - Batch Normalization, Layer Normalization and Group Normalization.
* Batch normalization is further used with L1 regularizaion (lambda = 0.001) 
* Test/validation loss and accuracy is understood for all 3 normalization techniques
* 10 Misclassified images are understood and presented, for each normalization technique
